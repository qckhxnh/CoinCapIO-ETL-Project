# CoinCapIO ETL Project

CoinCap.io is a popular cryptocurrency market data platform that provides real-time and historical information on various cryptocurrencies and digital assets. It serves as a valuable resource for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, traders, investors, and developers seeking to stay informed about the ever-evolving cryptocurrency markets.

CoinCap.io offers a user-friendly interface that displays essential data such as cryptocurrency prices, trading volumes, market capitalization, historical charts, and a variety of other market metrics. This project is a Python script that extracts cryptocurrency market data from the CoinCapIO API, transforms it, and loads it into a local PostgreSQL database. It can create a local database for further analysis, reporting, or other cryptocurrency-related applications.

Above is a screenshot of my local PostgreSQL database after the data was extracted, transformed and loaded.
