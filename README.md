# CoinCapIO ETL Project

CoinCap.io is a popular cryptocurrency market data platform that provides real-time and historical information on a wide range of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. It serves as a valuable resource for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, traders, investors, and developers seeking to stay informed about the ever-evolving cryptocurrency markets.

CoinCap.io offers a user-friendly interface that displays essential data such as cryptocurrency prices, trading volumes, market capitalization, historical charts, and a variety of other market metrics. Users can access this data via the CoinCap.io website or integrate it into their applications through CoinCap.io's API, allowing for seamless integration of cryptocurrency market data into various projects and services. This platform has become an essential tool for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, aiding in decision-making and market analysis within this rapidly growing and dynamic industry.

This project is a Python script that extracts cryptocurrency market data from the CoinCapIO API, transforms the data, and loads it into a local PostgreSQL database. It can be used to create a local database for further analysis, reporting, or other cryptocurrency-related applications.
