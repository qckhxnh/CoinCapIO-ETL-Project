# CoinCapIO ETL Project

This project is a Python script that extracts cryptocurrency market data from the CoinCapIO API, transforms the data, and loads it into a local PostgreSQL database. It can be used to create a local database for further analysis, reporting, or other cryptocurrency-related applications.
